Cera Round Pro v1.2
May 18 2018

Cera Pro, along with the Round and Stencil variants, has been improved and updated.

They all have new Cyrillics with the help of Ilya Ruderman and Yury Ostromentsky from type.today, Greek script support has been improved thanks to Irene Vlachou and, last but not least, Latin accents, kerning and combining marks plus minor curves have been optimized. Plus Alphabet Type helped to get the TrueType hinting better. Ceraâ€™s pan-European language support has been taken to the next level.
